# Code Design
• HTML and CSS are organized into separate files to maintain a clean and modular code structure. Semantic HTML tags such as header, nav, main, and others are utilized to enhance accessibility.
The CSS includes basic selectors (id, class, tag, element content, child, nth-of-type) and layout properties (width, height, color, background, font-size, border, padding, margin, display). 
Advanced layouts are created using Flexbox and Grid. Additional features include a CSS-based dropdown menu,
content generation with ::after and ::before, transitions, and animations modifying multiple properties.

• JavaScript is maintained in a separate file, modifying styles, manipulating the DOM, creating and deleting elements, handling mouse and keyboard events, and incorporating functional inputs.
The code employs setTimeout, setInterval, localStorage, and methods from Math, Array, String, and Date classes. It also includes random property changes, 
usage of classList, target, currentTarget, getComputedStyle, stopPropagation, and form validation using regular expressions. 
These integrated JavaScript functionalities enhance the interactivity and usability of the website.

• Node.js is used to handle GET/POST requests, manage sessions for login/logout, and provide a 404 error page. This server-side integration ensures a robust backend that complements the interactive front end.
