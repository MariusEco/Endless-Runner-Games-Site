      <h1>Precursors</h1>
      <br>
      <div>
        <p>The genre has its origins in the vertically scrolling video games of the 1970s, primarily racing games. The
          player always moves forward, avoiding obstacles and other vehicles. Taito's Speed Race, released in 1974, was
          the first. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the same concept was used in skiing games.</p>

        <p>Vehicle-oriented platform games, like Jump Bug (1981) and Moon Patrol (1982), added both jumping and shooting
          as
          ways to deal with obstacles in continually scrolling levels. The home game B.C.'s Quest for Tires (1983) uses
          the forced-scrolling and jumping gameplay of Moon Patrol.</p>

        <p>The idea of being chased relentlessly by an indestructible obstacle, monster, or boss to enforce forward
          progression was greatly influenced by the boulder scene from the 1981 film Raiders of the Lost Ark. This theme
          appeared in games like Draconian (1984) in which the player must avoid obstacles while being pursued by an
          invincible giant dragon. This would become a recurring theme of endless running gameplay.</p>

      <h1>Mobile gaming boom and the emergence of endless games</h1>
      <br>
      <p>The emergence of the touchscreen on smart phones and tablets paved the way for the type of simplistic game
        controls which gave birth to the modern genre.</p>

      <p>Doodle Jump (April 2009), a vertical scroller, was one of the first mobile titles to be endless, with game only
        ending when falling to the bottom of the screen or hitting an obstacle. It was to pave the way for even more
        popular titles.</p>

      <p>The prototypical endless runner, building on Doodle Jump's success, was Canabalt (August 2009), an indie game
        developed by Adam Saltsman in which the player flees from a city being destroyed by giant robots that is
        procedurally generated and infinite. Cannabalt used distance gained as the main scoring system. These were both
        common elements of subsequent runners. The 2D scroller limited movement to leaping and dodging obstacles simply
        by
        touching the screen, overcoming control limitation of touchscreen devices. Adult Swim Games soon asked
        Saltsman for permission to adapt Canabalt's design into their own title, and released Robot Unicorn Attack
        (2010).
        It became an internet meme due to Adult Swim's larger audience and its quirky themes.</p>

      <p>Within just months, the App Store was full of 2D endless runner clones. Some of the more popular 2D mobile
        titles
        included Tiny Wings (February 2011), Jetpack Joyride (September 2011), Punch Quest (2012) and Flappy Bird
        (2013).
        Running with Friends (2013) is notable in its effort to integrate with Facebook to support social multiplayer
        running.</p>

      <h1>Transition to 3D</h1>
      <br>
      <p>Hugo featured 3D endless running already in 1990.</p>

      <p>Bit.Trip Runner (2010) added rhythm game elements and was also one of the first in the genre to be rendered in
        2.5D.</p>

      <p>Another of the earliest 3D titles in the genre was Temple Run (August, 2011), introducing an over-the-shoulder
        viewpoint. Temple Run was followed by numerous clones and 3D innovations. Among the more popular third person
        3D titles were Subway Surfers and Agent Dash (2012). Subway Surfers went on to become the most popular game of
        the
        2010s, the first game to reach 1 billion downloads and with a total of 2.7 billion downloads achieved revenues
        of
        over $80 million through monetization.</p>

      <h1>Peak popularity</h1>
      <br>
      <p>During the 2010s numerous large franchises adapted their gameplay into endless runner mobile spin-offs. The 2010s
      these included reboots of classic video games as endless runners including the notable titles: Pitfall! (2012),
      Rayman Jungle Run (2012), Rayman Fiesta Run, Sonic Dash and Pac-Man Dash! (2013), Crossy Road (2014), Lara
      Croft: Relic Run and Pac-Man 256 (2015). Original titles were often lost in the sea of generic titles,
      rare exceptions were Race The Sun (2013) and Alto's Adventure (2015) which received positive reviews.</p>

      <p>Google's Dinosaur Game (2014) was released at the height of the endless running craze with developers in September
      2018 revealling that it had been played approximately 270 million times monthly. Microsoft was later to do the
      same with Surf (2020).</p>

      <p>Post 2010s the format has been criticised for being uninspired, particularly the adapted franchises, and a genre
      lacking ongoing innovation.</p>
